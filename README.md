# Action Man
Action Man is a simple tool allowing you to use blender actions to their full potential.

# Features
- Clean action: Removes all the animation data for a channel if the keyframes all have equal values.
- Create Constraints: Creates an action constraint on every object (usually bones) affected by the action.
    All the settings above the `Create Constraints` will directly be used on the action constraint.
